**Engagement**

Looking back at my midterm evaluation and where we were as a team at that point in the semester, it’s clear that we made significant progress. While the final write-up was not the deliverable we originally envisioned, it ultimately became the most thoughtful and responsible outcome we could have produced given the limitations of the data and the nature of our relationship with the sponsor.

My first two sprints were honestly challenging. At the beginning of the semester, I was adjusting to several new commitments at once, including stepping into my role as senior class president, applying to jobs, working, and managing responsibilities outside of class. Because of this, my level of engagement during Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 was not where I wanted it to be. As the semester went on (especially after fall break) I began to better understand how much time each of my commitments realistically required. Most of my job application deadlines were concentrated in September and October, and once those passed, I was able to be more intentional about how I allocated my time.

A key turning point for me was our meeting with Nikko on the third floor of Neilson, where we sat down and mapped out what the next four to five weeks of the project would look like. That conversation helped me reframe both the project and my role within it. From that point on, I consistently contributed around four to five hours per week. I also appreciated being able to take ownership over a specific aspect of the project. Since other teammates focused on variables such as sexuality, gender, and race, I chose to focus on politics, specifically how respondents express political identity and how survey questions frame political ideology.

Given how demanding this semester was overall, I was very intentional about how I used my time. My work outside of meetings was more limited, but I came to meetings prepared, followed through on the tasks I committed to, and tried to make our meetings as productive as possible. As we transitioned from analysis toward writing, GitHub became less central to our workflow. That said, I continued to stay organized by tracking progress in shared Google Docs, communicating consistently on Slack, saving resources in Zotero, and participating in stand-ups and after-class check-ins.

**Learning**

Although this project involved less technical coding and quantitative analysis than I initially expected, it taught me a significant amount about what ethical and responsible data analysis looks like in practice. One of the most important lessons I took away from this class is that ethical analysis sometimes means choosing not to analyze the data at all. Recognizing the limitations and ethical concerns embedded in the dataset—and acting on that recognition, was a meaningful and difficult learning experience.

Through this project, I learned how data collection methods, survey design, and question framing shape the conclusions that can be drawn. We spent a substantial amount of time engaging with academic literature, library resources, and online materials focused on ethical data collection, particularly around sensitive topics such as political ideology and LGBTQ+ experiences. This made it clear how easily poorly framed questions can oversimplify identities, introduce bias, or contribute to harmful or misleading interpretations.

In addition to this conceptual learning, I also developed new technical and collaborative skills. On GitHub, I learned how to create issues, assign tasks, tag teammates, and organize work through milestones. Even when GitHub became less central later in the semester, these project management skills continued to shape how I approached collaboration, accountability, and communication.

When I look back on this class, I will describe it as an experience that taught me how to think critically about data beyond numbers: how to question whether an analysis should be done in the first place, who it serves, and what responsibilities data scientists have when working with sensitive populations.

**Proficiency**

The aspect of this project that I am most genuinely proud of is our willingness to advocate for what we believed was ethically sound. Applying what we learned about responsible data practices, we made the deliberate decision not to use the dataset for quantitative analysis. This decision required confidence in our reasoning and trust in our understanding of ethical data science.

As part of this pivot, I developed strong proficiency in the research and synthesis side of data science. I read over twenty academic articles focused on politics and LGBTQ+ dating experiences, which allowed me to build meaningful subject-matter expertise. I am confident explaining how the framing of political questions, whether through rigid labels or overly broad categories, can influence user experiences on dating apps, including confusion, misrepresentation, and negative interactions.

Rather than producing surface-level analysis, I learned how to synthesize findings across sources, identify patterns, and clearly explain why certain approaches to data collection are limiting or harmful. This project strengthened my ability to connect ethical theory to real project decisions and to defend those decisions in a thoughtful and well-supported way.

**Professionalization**

This project pushed me to grow professionally, especially in how I communicate, set boundaries, and navigate challenging team and sponsor dynamics. Working with teammates who had different working styles required patience, clarity, and intentional communication. Early in the semester, we were relatively lenient with our sponsor, Jack, even when his lack of organization and unclear expectations created confusion and stress for the team.

With Nikko's support and engagment, we learned how to advocate for ourselves more directly. This meant setting clearer expectations, asking for clarification, and communicating concerns in a professional and constructive way. Our final meeting with Jack was especially difficult, but it was also one of the strongest examples of professionalism for me. Despite the discomfort, we chose to have a direct closing conversation, clearly articulate where we stood, and end the project respectfully.
