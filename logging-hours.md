# Logging Hours

Many of us work at consultancy firms in which we are required to track billable hours to a particular client or project. 

Each week, you are expected to log 12 hours per week in the `work-log.csv` file.  Whether or not you log 12 hours/week will have no bearing on your grade.  In these class, these work logs are neither surveillance, nor punishment, but an exercise designed to prepare you for professional data science work.  

Logging your time will also help you refine your estimation skills, making you a more accurate estimator of how long a task will take.
