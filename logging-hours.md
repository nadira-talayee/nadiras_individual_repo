**Week 1**
1)  Getting familiar with the topic and language around LGBTQ+ dating apps. A lot of the terms were new to me, so it took extra time to understand what the survey questions were really asking.
2_ One thing I did well this week:
 I did extra reading outside of what was required so I could better understand the context before working with the data.
3) One thing I learned this week:
 How much the wording of survey questions affects the kind of analysis you can do later.

**Week 2**
O1)  Connecting the data justice readings to our actual project and dataset.
2) 
 I came to class prepared with discussion questions and stayed engaged with the readings.
3) 
 That even well-intentioned data projects can still be extractive.

**Week 3**
1) Figuring out where to start with the analysis since the dataset was very large and messy.
2)  I narrowed my focus to age so I could actually start doing analysis instead of feeling stuck.
3)  scoping my work early makes a big difference.

**Week 4**
- One challenge I solved this week:
 Dealing with coding and Git issues while still making progress.
- One thing I did well this week:
 I created visualizations and tables that helped show patterns in negative experiences across apps.
- One thing I learned this week:
 How inconsistent survey responses can be, especially with write-in answers.
**Week 5**
1)  Handling misspellings and figuring out how to summarize write-in responses.
2) I went back to the raw survey responses instead of just relying on cleaned data.
3) That data cleaning involves a lot of judgment calls.

**Week 6**
1) Linking my age-based findings to broader discussions about politics on dating apps.
2) I spent time reading and annotating papers that helped shape my written section.
3)  That political disclosure works very differently in dating app settings.
**Week 7**
1) Deciding whether to focus on politics or income as my main variable.
2) I took time to think through what made the most sense for the project instead of rushing a decision.
3) That narrowing a research question takes time and iteration.
**Week 8**
1)  Writing about ethics and limitations in a clear and specific way.
2) I outlined my section before writing, which made drafting easier.
3) How risky political disclosure can be for LGBTQ+ users.
**Week 9**
1) Pulling together readings on political signaling and applying them to dating apps.
2) One thing I did well this week:
 I edited my section to make my argument clearer and more focused.
3) One thing I learned this week:
 That political signaling can affect dating outcomes.

**Week 10**
- One challenge I solved this week:
 Connecting course readings to our project in a meaningful way.
- One thing I did well this week:
 I organized my notes into clear takeaways for the final paper.
- One thing I learned this week:
 That data collection is never neutral.
**Week 11**
- One challenge I solved this week:
 Working through dense academic readings and figuring out what was relevant.
- One thing I did well this week:
 I focused my writing on the parts of the readings that actually applied to our project.
- One thing I learned this week:
 More about the limits of drawing conclusions from aggregated data.

**Week 12**
- One challenge I solved this week:
 Balancing finishing my draft with reviewing my teammates’ sections.
- One thing I did well this week:
 I finished a full draft on time and gave feedback on other sections.
- One thing I learned this week:
 How much clearer the project felt once the paper structure was finalized.
