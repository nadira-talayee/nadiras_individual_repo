## Qualitative Evaluation

Amaya
What’s going well:
 Amaya has been doing well with initiating tasks and taking ownership of her variable. She has been open about the issues she’s noticing with race as a variable, especially around how respondents are categorized, and she’s been actively trying to work through both the conceptual challenges and some technical challenges in R. I appreciate that she’s been vocal about what feels unclear rather than pushing forward without questioning it.
What she’s struggling with:
 At times, it hasn’t been fully clear what specific analysis Amaya has completed or what direction her work is taking. There were moments where she seemed unsure about what we were supposed to be doing next or how to move forward. I’ve felt this uncertainty too, and I think a lot of it comes from the lack of clear guidance from our supervisor rather than from her individually.
Growth area:
 Amaya has been catching up on readings and previously pending tasks, which has helped her gain more clarity and confidence in her work. A continued growth area would be translating that understanding into more concrete updates about what she’s tried, what worked, and what didn’t, so the rest of the team can stay aligned.

Callie
What’s going well:

 Callie is making steady progress on her analysis and has been strong with time management and setting boundaries, which I personally find difficult and really admire. She did a great job communicating with Jack about logistics, especially in clearly expressing that we preferred a Zoom meeting over an in-person one. That helped the team a lot and showed strong advocacy and communication.
What she’s struggling with:
 Even though we are approaching demo day and the slides are coming together, I’m still not fully sure what specific aspect of sexuality Callie is focusing on or what challenges she’s running into analytically. This isn’t about effort, but more about clarity and visibility into her work.
Growth area:
 Callie has been trying to communicate more consistently with the team and has been good about letting us know in advance when something might not go as planned. Continuing to share more detail about the direction and scope of her analysis would help strengthen group alignment as we move forward.
Claire
What’s going well:
 Claire has been very aware of how nuanced and ethically complex her variable is. She’s been honest about uncertainty and actively engaged in conversations about how difficult it is to interpret gender data responsibly. She also played an important role in communicating our concerns with the supervisor to Nikko, which helped validate issues the team was feeling.
What she’s struggling with:
 Claire seemed to struggle at times with setting a clear analytical direction, particularly around location-based analysis, where the data uses broad categories like urban, suburban, and rural rather than specific locations. This felt more like a limitation of the variable and the data itself than a personal struggle. I remember her mentioning that she was in touch with Nikko and had already discussed these concerns.
Growth area:
 A major growth area for Claire is framing what she’s working with and clarifying how she wants to articulate her conclusions. One strength she has is her gut instinct to recognize when something in the analysis doesn’t quite make sense and to pause rather than force it. Acting on that instinct and turning it into clearer language and structure is something that’s developing and will continue to improve.
