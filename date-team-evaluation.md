### Qualitative Evaluation
_Describe how your team is performing.  For example, do you think you are making good progress towards goals?  Are your estimates accurate? As a general guideline, this section should be no fewer than 3 sentences, and no more than about 15 sentences._
Our team has been working individually throughout this project due to the our scedule and prefrences as well. While this makes communication or knowing what stage of the work/project others are on a bit tricky, we have done a good job keeping up with our sprint planning and stand-ups as well as staying responsive over Slack. Our Project pivoted from data analysis to writing a paper, which is not what we had in mind, but I am equally happy. Our team had diffrences in how we work or do the writing. However, we found a good we to compromise and get what each of us wanted. Part of our confusion and complication was because of our sponsor's lack os clear expectations and guidlines. However, after we decided to continue on with writing a paper, things started to fall in place. 

## Individual Contributor Evaluation

I am in a a place where I feel great both about my final deliveryables and my team contributions. Having decided to pivot from our data analysis project to a write-up before thanksgiving break did switch things up a bit for us. Our team dynamics has had its ups and downs, but that has never impacted my workflow. Even in the case of diffrences in our work style, we managed to compromise or get tasks done in a way that works out for everyone. 

### Quantitative Evaluation

(on a scale of 1 - 4; 1 is inadequate, 4 is excellent)
Communication: Due to our limitted availability outside class, and prefrence to work individually, this meant most of our communciation was online. Sometimes this was not ideal and led to confusion. 
Quality of Work: I really feel accomplished about our write-up. I believe our final paper is coherent, well-eourced and written, and follows the general structure and guidlines we agreed on for the paper as well as our individual sections. 
Reliability: I felt that I could trust everyone in the team for doing their sections and also being reasonable with deadlines. 
Good Teammate: I liked the people I had in my team. We were not best friends, but we learned to respect and grow a tolerance for our diffrences and work together.

### Qualitative Evaluation
**Amaya Cano**

1. Amaya brought really good attitude to the group throughout the project. She asked thoughtful questions and was especially good at spotting challenges in the data around the Race variable and why it mattered for people’s experiences on dating apps. Early on, when we each took ownership of a variable, Amaya focused on race and consistently raised concerns about lack of diversity and the ethical implications of drawing conclusions from limited or uneven data. She was also responsive and willing to help wherever she could. I’m really excited to read her individual section on race and how we think about framing questions around race in dating app research.

2. During the first couple of sprint planning phases, Amaya was still getting used to GitHub and some of the technical workflow, like creating projects, staging, and pushing changes. She also ran into some issues with her local R setup. As the GitHub lead for Sprint 1, I helped her get set up, and pretty quickly she was able to figure things out on her own or reach out to Nikko when needed. I’m still waiting on her individual write-up so I can leave comments and feedback once it’s in.

3. Over time, Amaya became much more comfortable using R and GitHub. I also know she had some ongoing family matters that affected her workflow at times. Despite that, she kept putting in the work that was asked of her and stayed engaged with the group. I’m looking forward to reading her final section.

**Claire Kelley**

1. We decided to maintain our assigned roles from Sprint 1, and as project lead, Claire did a strong job acting as both a leader and a mediator. She was organized, engaged, and consistently willing to support team members when they ran into roadblocks. One example that stands out was during our Sprint 3 meeting, when we had differing perspectives on how to go about writing the paper and the structure the write-up and individual sections. Claire proposed a solution that helped us move forward and align as a group.

2. Because much of the quantitative analysis was done individually, I did not have as much visibility into Claire’s technical work specifically. In terms of team communication, however, there were moments when discussions felt slightly dismissive of alternative approaches, with a tendency to move forward with what she believed was the best plan. This occasionally came up during group meetings or in communication involving Jack.

3. Over time, Claire showed growth in collaborating with others and incorporating multiple perspectives into decision-making. I think continuing to slow down group discussions and creating more space for differing viewpoints would further strengthen her leadership, especially in collaborative and interdisciplinary settings.

**Callie Showalter**

1. Callie was responsible for sponsor communication, and she did a strong job maintaining the connection between our team, Jack, and Nikko. She took this role seriously and helped ensure that information was shared clearly, even when communication with our sponsor was sometimes challenging. I admire Calie's strength in setting clear boundries with her work hours and availability outside class. 

2. One area Callie struggled with initially was navigating the uncertainty around when and how to reach out to Jack, especially when we needed to reschedule meetings or clarify expectations. Her thoughtfulness and consideration for others sometimes translated into anxiety around communication. Recognizing this, I offered to help draft or send messages or bring up a hard topic during our chat with Jack as needed, and over time this aspect improved.

3. Callie has grown in her confidence around professional communication and setting boundaries. A continued growth area would be becoming more comfortable initiating difficult or ambiguous conversations, particularly in sponsor-facing roles, where clarity and timeliness is very important.
