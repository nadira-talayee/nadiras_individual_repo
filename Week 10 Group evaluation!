We all are concerned about how our data analysis and written pieces were coming together. I have been working on the age variable and its relationship to negative experiences, which is relatively straightforward and less ethically ambiguous to analyze, since age is a non-fluctuating variable. In contrast, my teammates have been working with variables such as race, gender, and sexuality, which are far more nuanced and raise important ethical concerns around categorization and interpretation.
Conversations with our project sponsor were not very productive in addressing these concerns or in helping us clearly define variables and analytical boundaries. Because we were each working independently on different variables, it was often difficult to know what others were focusing on or how their work was evolving. While my analysis on age and negative experiences was fairly contained, I found that the unresolved concerns around other variables began to affect my own sense of clarity and direction.

Communication: 
This dynamic also affected how we used in-class work time. I wanted to use that time primarily for coding and analysis, while Callie and Claire often wanted to use it to talk through the challenges they were facing. Given my responsibilities outside of class and the fact that I am actively job searching, I have been very intentional about how I use my time, and these discussions did not always feel like the best use of limited work time for me. And sometimes the discussion went off tangent. 
This led to some tension within the team. While I felt that individual challenges were beginning to affect the group as a whole, my need to use class time as focused work time was not always accommodated. I want to emphasize that this was not about unwillingness to engage, but rather about balancing collaboration with individual productivity and capacity. 
The third sprint meeting, however, marked a positive shift. Reframing the project as a paper, rather than a purely analytical deliverable, gave us more flexibility and aligned much more closely with the ethical questions we had been grappling with—particularly around how data is collected, framed, and interpreted. The paper format allows us to maintain a shared framework while still working in parallel on individual sections.
Moving forward, each team member will continue writing on the variable they have been analyzing: Claire on gender, Callie on sexuality, and Amaya on race. I plan to focus on a variable or thematic aspect that I am personally interested in, though I am still deciding between income, politics, or more broadly how questions are framed and categorized in LGBTQ dating research. This direction feels both intellectually engaging and ethically grounded, and it allows me to contribute meaningfully while staying aligned with the overall structure of the project.
